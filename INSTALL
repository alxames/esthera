Esthera - INSTALL
=================

Esthera comes with hand-written Makefiles. The paths to CUDA/OpenCL includes
and libraries needs to be indicated. We will improve this later.

Currently, Esthera has only been tested under Linux.


Retrieving Esthera
------------------

To grab a copy of the Esthera repository into a (new) directory 'esthera', run:

        git clone https://github.com/alxames/esthera.git esthera


Build Instructions
------------------

	cd src/partfilt/cuda
	make
	cd ../opencl
	make

There are no test cases and install/uninstall at the moment.


Dependencies
------------

	gcc/g++ or llvm/clang
	make


For CUDA runs, you need a recent NVIDIA GPU driver and CUDA SDK.

For OpenCL runs, you need to have set up:
	/etc/OpenCL/vendors/*.icd
	libOpenCL.so
	platform specific runtime libraries

For x86(-64) CPUs, we recommend Intels' OpenCL SDK. AMD's APP SDK works too,
but is slower with Esthera.
For running OpenCL code on NVIDIA GPUs, install a recent CUDA SDK and driver.
For AMD GPUs, install the a recent APP SDK and driver.
We have not tried to run the OpenCL code on other hardware platforms.

You need to indicate the installed include and library paths in the Makefile.
We will supply more user friendly package auto-configuration scripts later.
