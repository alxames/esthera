Esthera - README
================

Esthera is a software toolkit to prototype fast particle filters on multi-
core hardware platforms.

The particle filter is a Bayesian estimation technique based on Monte Carlo
simulation. It is ideal for state estimation in non-linear, non-Gaussian
dynamical systems. New algorithmic variants are still being researched and
there are many ways to trade-off estimation accuracy vs. execution speed.
Esthera has been developed to compare algorithmic variants and research their
performance trade-offs.

Esthera grew out of a research cooperation at Delft University of Technology,
The Netherlands, and is still under development. Not all developed sources and
tools have been released yet, and the released code needs additional cleanup
and at least one easy to run, insightful example to be useful to others.

If you are interested in using Esthera, or have a question or bug to report,
please contact us (see CONTRIBUTING).
